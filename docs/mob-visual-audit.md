# Mob visual audit

A record of what every mob actually renders, taken from the **models and textures in this repo**, not from an
assumption that "the mob exists" means "the mob looks right". Two pilots are finished in this pass; the rest of
the roster is listed with its real state so the remaining work is visible rather than implied.

Reference plan: the visual-parity implementation plan this file belongs to.

## Why this pass exists

Two defects were reported from the Mob Inspector, and both had the same shape: the mob existed, had correct
health, dropped correct loot, and passed every behavioural test, while looking wrong.

| Reported | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| "snow golem doesn't have a face" | The carved pumpkin was a plain orange box with a dark rectangle stuck on the front. One material cannot put a picture on one face of a cube, and the real carved-pumpkin block was never used. |
| "husk looks the same as zombie" | The husk reused `zombie.png` and then wrote ONE colour over every material on the model. That flattens the skin, the clothing, the boots and any equipped item into a single hue. |

Neither was visible to a behavioural test. That is the lesson this file encodes.

## Assets

Real vanilla textures are fetched, not generated, by `scripts/mob-visual/fetch-assets.mjs` into
`public/assets/...`, mirroring the vanilla layout so a skin can replace a placeholder directly. Every byte is
locked by SHA-256 in `scripts/mob-visual/assets.lock.json`, with per-asset release provenance.

The wiki serves the same textures but answers scripted downloads with **HTTP 403**, so a mirror of the client
jar's assets is used. That is the only reason for the indirect source; the bytes are the originals.

More than one release is pinned, because these mobs did not all exist at once:

| Ref | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `1.21.4` | everything current, including `bogged` (a 1.21 mob) |
| `1.20.4` | fallback for assets that predate the newer ref |

```bash
node scripts/mob-visual/fetch-assets.mjs          # download anything missing, then verify
node scripts/mob-visual/fetch-assets.mjs --verify # fail if anything is missing or changed
```

## Finished pilots

### Snow golem

**Before:** three white boxes, two thin sticks, and an orange cube for a head with a dark rectangle on the front.

**After:** the same silhouette, but the pumpkin is a real carved-pumpkin block — the grin on the front, plain
rind on the sides and back, the stem end on top — assembled from six materials with explicit atlas rectangles.
The golem's own head uses its entity skin, which carries the carved snow face, and the stick arms sample the
brown wood patch from the same sheet.

Key detail: a `16x16` block texture on a default `BoxGeometry` shows the same picture on all six sides. The
per-face rectangles are what put the face on `+Z` only.

| State | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Pumpkin equipped (default) | done — carved face on the front |
| Pumpkin sheared (head visible) | the head and its snow face are built; the shear transition is the existing behaviour code, not changed here |
| Head follows yaw/pitch | existing behaviour, unchanged |
| Throw pose | existing behaviour, unchanged |

### Husk

**Before:** a zombie with one flat sand colour over every material.

**After:** the husk's **own** vanilla skin, untinted. The recolour is skipped precisely when the real skin is in
use (`hasOriginalSkin`), because that recolour is what destroyed the clothing and any equipped item. When the
asset is absent — a bare checkout — the generated tint still applies, so the fallback is visibly a husk rather
than an untinted zombie, and the fallback path is covered by a test.

| State | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Adult | done — own skin, no whole-model tint |
| Baby | uses the shared baby scale behaviour, unchanged |
| Equipped item | no longer tinted, because the tint is skipped for the real skin |
| Zombie regression | covered by a test: the zombie is still untinted and unchanged |

## Roster state

Every other family below is **unaudited to source** in this pass. Each row names what the model currently does,
so the remaining work is enumerated rather than silently skipped. `tint` means the mob derives its skin from a
relative and writes one colour over the model, which has the same flattening defect the husk had.

| Family | Model today | Outstanding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zombie / skeleton variants | husk, stray, bogged now load own skins; drowned, parched still tint-derived | drowned overlay, bogged overlay + sheared state, parched own skin |
| Humanoids | villager and pillager have real skins; illagers, witch, iron golem partly flat colours | illager noses/arms, witch hat, iron golem vines and damage cracks, piglin equipment layers |
| Common animals | pig, cow, sheep, chicken have real skins | wool/sheared/dye layers, mooshroom mushrooms, horse markings and armour |
| Variant animals | mostly tinted relatives | cat/wolf coats and collars, fox/rabbit/frog/axolotl/parrot variants, panda faces, llama decor |
| Aquatic | generated textures | real fins/gills/tails/tentacles, pufferfish stages, tropical-fish patterns, guardian eye/spikes |
| Creepers / arachnids / small | creeper has a real skin | charged overlay, spider eyes and legs, silverfish/endermite segments, bat/bee wing poses |
| Nether | ghast, piglin, wither skeleton assets present | blaze rods, magma cube segments, hoglin tusks, strider cold state, brute clothing |
| End / hostile specials | enderman, shulker modelled | enderman eyes, shulker shell opening, phantom wings, warden tendrils, breeze/creaking structures, vex/allay wings |
| Large / boss | dragon and wither modelled | neck/tail/wing hierarchy, wither heads, emissive features, framing for large bounds |
| Newer implemented mobs | camel, sniffer, allay, armadillo, breeze and friends implemented | later-release asset references must be matched and acquired before their appearance is edited |

## Gaps recorded deliberately

- **No source model JSON was obtained.** The model definitions (`snow_golem.json` and peers) were not reachable
  from the pinned asset mirrors, which ship only textures. Geometry and UVs in this pass were therefore derived
  from the **texture atlas itself**, measured by decoding the PNG and sampling it, plus the published mob
  dimensions. Any family whose geometry needs to match vanilla cube-by-cube should acquire those model files
  first; guessing them from collision dimensions would be wrong.
- **The wiki's reference renders could not be downloaded** (HTTP 403), so no side-by-side pixel comparison
  against a wiki image is claimed anywhere. The evidence is rendered from the real assets in this repo.
- **Only two mobs are finished.** The roster above is not parity; it is an inventory.

## Evidence

`docs/mob-visual-evidence/` holds rendered captures. Each names the mob, the view, and what it demonstrates.
They were produced by rendering the real `MobManager` in a real browser — not from Node mocks, which cannot see
texture upload at all.

## What verifying against the live Inspector caught

The first pass was checked in a page that advanced the manager every frame, and both pilots looked right there.
The real `mob-debug.html` **spawns its mob and then sits paused**, so nothing per-frame runs at all. Anything that
finished a job "on the next update" therefore never finished it in the Inspector — the snow golem shipped as a
flat orange box while its own unit tests and a self-written harness both passed.

Three faults hid behind that one difference, and all three are now fixed and tested:

1. Deferred skin binding was driven from `manager.update`, which a paused session never calls.
2. `loadTexture` passed no `onLoad`, and supplying one *suppresses* three's default listener — so the texture's
   own `load` event never fired either, and both routes to completion were dead.
3. The readiness test asked whether an image object **existed** rather than whether it had decoded. Three's loader
   creates the `<img>` immediately, so that check was true from the start.

The lesson is in the plan and worth repeating: **a capture from a purpose-built harness is not an Inspector
check.** The Inspector's own spawn-and-pause behaviour is part of the fixture, and a page that ticks is a
different fixture. Every capture in this directory was taken from the real `mob-debug.html` endpoint.
